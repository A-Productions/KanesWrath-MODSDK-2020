This is advanced BuildMod and buildMap bats for C&C3 Tiberium wars mod SDK ,

The bat will stop the process if the error is found ...

if you wish to troubleshoot the code looking for any "missing errors" that are not real errors
 but is important cause you can see if you have misspelled something..etc ; note that this
also requires some knowing of the code , the errors about models missing are to be ignored
the real errors are between the code and do look different so it is spotable

So make a shortcut to the desired bat and set the height buffer(in settings) to 9999 , the horizontal buffer should be about 100
customize your window so it will appear at center and make it more wide too , this will be easier for spoting/reading the code ...

Fixmanifest will fix the mod crash while changing graphics settings from high to low or from low to high. Fixmanifest.exe run from the buildmod.bat, but you need to paste it to the TW\SDK\Tools
The code is already in the .bat.


Legal: This is not been made directly by me , the buildmod bat i just got from the web 
the I added the "plese insert a name" at start so no commandline is needed also I incorporated
Asset resolver to resolve civilian models ... BuildModCivAsset.bat is no longer needed...

I also made an advanced BuildMap.bat form the BuildMod.bat example ...
